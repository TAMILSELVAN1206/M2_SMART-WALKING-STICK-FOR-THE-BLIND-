# **SMART WALKING STICK**

## INTRODUCTION
The project describes ultrasonic blind walking stick with the use of Arduino. According to World Health Organization (WHO), 30 million people are permanently blind and 2.85 million people with vision impairment. If you notice them, you can very well know about it they canâ€™t walk without the help of other. One has to ask guidance to reach their destination. They have to face more struggles in their life daily life. Using this blind stick, a person can walk more confidently. This stick detects the object in front of the person and give response to the user either by vibrating or through command. So, the person can walk without any fear. This device will be best solution to overcome their difficulties. We are going to upgrade the project by increasing its application. In this project, we are going to use two ultrasonic sensors. So now, this smart stick will have an ultrasonic sensor to sense distance from any obstacle and a RF remote using which the blind man could remotely locate his stick.
